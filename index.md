# Josh Sambrano
#### Biostatistics Master's Student | Clinical Researcher | Clinical Trial Associate

## Who I am

I’m a clinical research professional with a strong quantitative foundation, driven by a deep interest in advancing therapies for diseases with high unmet medical need—particularly in oncology.

## What I do
I currently work as a Senior Clinical Trial Associate at Revolution Medicines, where I support the coordination, execution, and monitoring of precision oncology trials targeting RAS-mutated cancers. In parallel, I’m pursuing a Master’s degree in Biostatistics and Data Science at Brown University, building advanced skills in statistical modeling, data analysis, and clinical trial methodology.

## What I’m focused on now
Right now, I’m focused on strengthening the bridge between clinical operations and data-driven decision-making—developing technical skills in biostatistics, statistical programming, and applied data science while gaining hands-on experience in oncology clinical trials. My commitment to impactful research has been recognized through honors such as the Moonstone Cancer Research Fellowship and Public Health Honor Award from Brown.

## Where I’m headed
Long term, my goal is to move into quantitatively focused roles—such as biostatistics, statistical programming, or quantitative research—where I can directly influence trial design, analysis, and evidence generation to accelerate the development of transformative cancer therapies.

## Research
My research interests lie at the intersection of oncology, data science, and clinical evidence generation, with a focus on translating complex clinical and real-world data into actionable insights. I’m particularly interested in health outcomes research, HEOR/RWE, and applying statistical and machine-learning methods to evaluate treatment effectiveness, safety, and patient-centered outcomes.

## Out of Office
Outside of work and school, I stay active and creative—playing beach volleyball and basketball, camping, traveling the world, and spending time outdoors with my Belgian Malinois. I also enjoy building things, whether that’s physical models, programming projects, or making music on guitar, which keeps me grounded and curious beyond my professional and academic endeavors.
